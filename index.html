If you are just here to look at what is in here and learn or get inspired, then sure,
look around. Just, do not mindlessly copy and paste. The worry is not that I am practically
being stolen from... the worry is the fact that you are leaving yourself
uneducated. Use it to learn not just to build. When the building collapses, without understanding
it's architecture... you will just end up unable to ever fix it again.


Here, the curious are commendable and shall be rewarded for their constant strive to make
the unknown become the known; their constant strive for more knowledge.
Look around these files, you will keep finding comments going over how features work with
sufficient details to quench your curiosity.

Just remember... learn. Do not copy. There is a difference between the two.
Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back.
Unfortunately, there is no satisfaction when you do not bother to understand.
So learn.
Okay, go on now. Go learn, and become even greater than before.
Chao.
