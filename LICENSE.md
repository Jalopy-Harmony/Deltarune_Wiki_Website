Same respects to the property as Toby Fox has asked to be used for his.
Do not utilize for commercial use.
Make sure to properly credit Toby Fox and his work.
If you use the website as a basis or rip parts from it and utilize those parts on your own... feel free to credit me if you want. I could not care less if I was not credited.
However, I could always care more if Toby Fox is not credited... so credit him.

# ***DO CREDIT TOBY FOX**

# The requirements are:
# 1. **Respect Toby Fox's wishes, in everything (e.g. licensing, property, use, etc.).**
# 2. **Respect Toby Fox's copyrights... so his wishes.**
# 3. **Respect Toby Fox's wishes.**
# 4. **Did I mention you should respect Toby Fox's wishes?**
# 5. **Check out what Toby Fox allows you to do, and not do... so that you can respect his wishes.**

Apart from that... steal my HTML, my CSS, my JavaScript... I don't really care. Would be respectful to credit me in some way if you did... buuuuuuut, as long as you're learning and improving and expressing yourself... I don't really mind.
Also, I pretty much only care that you give Toby Fox and everyone else the credit they deserve, and that you listen to their wishes and copyrights/trademarks.
